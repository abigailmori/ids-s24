        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Hi! My name is Abigail Mori and I am a current senior, graduating this May. This past summer I worked with the UConn's Center for Voting Technology Research. We used ACS data to analyze ease of voting within Connecticut. Though, I only used `sql` and never had to access this data through `python`. I am excited to show what I've learned over the past couple weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to properly access ACS data we will need make sure we have installed `cenpy` and `geodatasets`. `Cenpy` is a package that \"automatically discovers US Census Bureau API endpoints and exposes them to Python in a consistent fashion.\" `Geodatasets` \"contains an API on top of a JSON with metadata of externally hosted datasets containing geospatial information useful for illustrative and educational purposes.\" Both of these modules are dependent on `pandas`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accessing ACS Data\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many different kinds of census data, one of which is ACS (American Community Survery) data. The ACS data is made up of a \"wide range of social, economic, demographic, and housing charateristics.\" There are multiple ways to access this data using Python. I will examine one way using `cenpy`.\n",
        "\n",
        "For much of work I referenced a `cenpy` API reference page (https://cenpy-devs.github.io/cenpy/api.html)\n"
